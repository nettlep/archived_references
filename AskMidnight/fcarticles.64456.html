I've totally been boggled on this topic... Programming with multiple people.
How exactly do you do this without one good programmer taking over and doing
everything, while the others just sit there??? I'm guessing it involves some
good layouts of coding and game layouts.  But im lost on how to mesh
everything together that everyone has been working on.<br><br>It would be really helpfull if you can shed some light onto this topic, as I
havent been able to find much information on it.<br><br>-NetArc<br><br></font>

There isn't a definitive answer on this, though there are a lot of good
answers. Also, I usually try to stay away from those Ask Midnight questions
where my experience is lacking. In this case I personally feel there are a
lot of others far more qualified to answer this than me (I don't know if
I'll ever be satisfied with my design or managerial skills.) So I'm going to
get things started and hopefully, people will take the hint and share their
experience in the comments to follow.<br><br>As for myself, I think there are a few key components to a shared project:
<blockquote>
<li>1. A project lead - not necessarily the best programmer on the team, but
somebody well suited for overseeing the development process. Good personal
skills, good communication skills, etc. I also feel that it's important for
any leader to know the job of the people they lead. So this person should
have at least basic programming skills.
<li>2. A common design - A 'big picture' that all team members are familiar
with.
<li>3. A team of people that is capable of working as a team.
<li>4. Some form of RCS (revision control system) like SourceSafe.
</blockquote>
This list is short and only covers the critical pieces.<br><br>I don't feel there is any importance of one of the listed items over
another. This is because I've worked on successful projects where there was
no common design; the only person that knew the entire design was the
project lead. I've also worked on successful projects where the lead was
actually detrimental to the project's success. However, in this case the
team worked very well together was able to overcome the lead's shortcomings.<br><br>Also, I included RCS on the list because I simply can't imagine a project
without one. For those not familiar, I'll explain what a RCS is. A RCS is
simply a network tool that stores all of your source code in a common
database, allowing team members to "check out" files of a project. This
prevents two different team members from modifying the same file at the same
time. They also keep track of past revisions of every file in the project,
and who was responsible for each revision. They can also manage
automatically merging multiple changes to the same file by multiple
developers, when it's necessary for two people to have access to the same
source file simultaneously. A good RCS will do a lot more than this, too.<br><br>I want to address one specific area of your question. You asked how to
prevent one programmer from doing all the work while the others just sit
there. Though, this isn't always the case, it is often due to the one
programmer not trusting the others to do what that person considers "a good
job." This was my biggest hurdle to overcome when learning to work in a true
team environment. A good project lead or a team that works well together can
overcome this, like many other problematic areas of team development.

    This doesn't relate to 'game' development specifically, but the concept itself is pretty much the same across the board.<br><br>I'm presently working on a large scale project that consists of some 40 to 50 developers, if not more (I'm just one of the many).  Some of which are located at our offices here in California, the rest in Chicago.<br><br>Our company uses Clear Case for source control (more info about this tool can be found at www.rational.com).  It's an extremely complex tool in some aspect, but allows you to analyze, search, check and keep complete history and revision control pretty good.<br><br>The initial development process started out with many (many) discussions and meetings to scope out the design, data object models and requirements for various phases.<br><br>After the requirements were scoped out, group leaders were assembled and assigned 'chunks' of the development that were required.  Group leaders were developers, each had a sub-set of developers to work with.  Group leaders met with these developers and people were assigned a piece of the pie so to speak.<br><br>Once a week all developers 'check in' all their completed work thus far.  We have 3 people handling the 'build' process and managing the Clear Case tool.  We have a cut-off time that all source code must be checked in by, and then they lock the database for their build process.  The Clear Case group then compiles all the pieces that have been checked in and added into the final executable for testing.  Once they have hammered out any compiling issues and get a good build they then run a testing process against it for potential problems.  A list is compiled and then distributed to Group leaders (if the problem was found in the piece they were assigned).  And then it rolls down from there to the developers.<br><br>As development cycles move forward, each developer is basically tasked with keeping their piece in a state which can be compiled on the fly if needed.  Any new development they are currently working on that is not ready for deployment is basically not included for that week's build.  When new development is completed, on the day of 'check in' the developer(s) add their new segments for the next build.<br><br>Regular weekly meetings to review progress, analyze any existing or potential problems and how to resolve them.  Meetings are put together on the fly during mid-week if needed with the key group leaders to resolve any issues holding up development.<br><br>Granted, there are some development aspects that can not be completed until one of the other groups completes their piece.  In this regard, each group leader is assigned enough work that multiple areas could be development per developer so as not to hit this bottleneck.<br><br>As I mentioned above, the initial design is composed of several different phases.  The first phase is practically 'get it working', followed up by additional phases which are 'fine tuning'.<br><br>Since we have two locations doing simultaneous development, we have established a deadline for new code every Monday by 6:00p pst.  Since Chicago is 2 hours ahead of us we normally have their updates pulled across the WAN by the time our deadline hits in California.  Our staff that manage Clear Case then lock the database and work their mojo.<br><br>On Tuesday when we all return to work the Clear Case group has uploaded all the latest source code and unlocked the database.  We log into our systems and pull down the current build and all source code related to it and continue development.<br><br>On a side note, one strategy we use is one Group is not allowed to make any changes to another Group's objects (data or code) without consulting with the Group leader and getting a green light.  Allowing changes to be made without this sort of team work could potentially lead to quick chaos.  With a good Source Control management system this can also be easily reversed in the event it did happen.<br><br>However, by using the Clear Case tool it allows multiple developers to work on the same code segment and then merging all the changes from all developers into one final form.  We played around with this feature in the beginning and found that due to the complexity of our project it wasn't as feasable as might be for a smaller project.  In the end we ended up using the strategy just referenced above.<br><br>In our case, there is clearly no 'one' developer that is going to do all the work while the rest of us sit around drinking beer cheering them on. =)<br><br>Hope I didn't ramble on too much, and that some of this might be useful to you. =)  Excuse the punctuation and grammar, I'm a software developer--not an English major. =P<br>

    The first thing is you need a design philosophy. Typically a design philosophy will contain three specific items. The first item is the development structure to use for a particular project (I recommend you use the book "Rapid Development" by Steve McConnell). I'm partial to evolutionary or incremental development (I can give you a page number if you are interested), which may not be applicable to many aspects of game development, but many of the models mentioned in the book should meet your needs. The second item you need is a decision making heirarchy. Who has what authority to make decisions, and what is the path for escalation? A personell model that I'm partial to is as follows:<br><br>Project Tech Lead<br>   - Component Tech Lead<br>     -- Component Implementors<br>   - Component Tech Lead<br>     -- Component Implementors<br>   - Component Tech Lead<br>     -- Component Implementors<br><br>Depending on the experience of the team you are working with, the project technical lead and the component tech leads may be the same person. This is nice as it provides growth paths for individuals who are stepping up and executing well. The third item in the design philosophy is a role for each of the titles (tech lead, component lead, and implementor), in a generic sense. A good example would be the project technical lead is responsible for inter-component communcation.<br><br>The second thing that you need is a specification. What is the exact task you are trying to solve (project as a whole)? This may be extensive, but should be presented heirarchally.<br><br>The next thing is a global design document that reflects clear interfaces between modules and submodules, as well as tasks for each submodule. Clear interfaces reduce dependencies by allowing some subsystems to be black boxed and tested independantly.<br><br>The final key in understanding all of this is the double "D" of development: discipline and delegation. Discipline comes into play by performing the above tasks and resisting urges to go beyond your role. Delegation does an amazing thing for productivity. If you are twice the programmer than each of your two or three team mates, delegating tasks to them (even though you could do a better job) saves time in the long run. Four people can accomplish way more than one. <br><br>I personally have been dealing with a lot of issues around this very subject. In order to keep my sanity I've instituted some of this on my own, and the results have been nothing but positive. Some might argue that this is stuffy management based stifling process, but in a team environment, it really does increase productivity. I personally will take process for results any day. <br><br>Unfortunetly most of this is learned the hard way. There isn't really a short cut through all of this (having it rammed down your throat by management is not a shortcut...). The only thing I can really recommend is to have all of the information concerning philosophy, design and specifications in a public repository for all to see.<br>

    What Cider describes is a working model for a large team. If you are (thinking of) working in a smaller team, here are my experiences:<br><br>First of all, RCS is ALWAYS useful. I totally agree with Paul when he says he cannot imagine a project without it. SourceSafe and ClearCase are both very good, but unfortunately also very expensive. We've used CVS for quite a while now, and although fairly basic, it covers our needs and is <a href="http://www.cvshome.org/">available for free</a><br><br>Secondly, in my mind there two things that, if done properly, can provide a huge leap in your chances of successfully completing the project: Requirements (Scope) and Design. <br><br>Before a letter of code is written, scope your project (ie. _what_ are you going to make?) AND STICK TO IT! Feature creep is probably the most common problem in (software-)projects. Of course it is cool to add little extra things, but it is much cooler to finish the project on time and with high-quality code (Both of which are at risk if you don't stick to your scope). This doesn't mean there is no room for change in scope. But any change should be carried our very deliberately and well structured.<br><br>Design is what I think makes or breaks team-development. And within Design, it's the Interface-design which is most important and which enables a team to work effectively. If you and another coder work on different modules that need to communicate, and up front you firmly agree on an interface, it doesn't matter if the other guy is in the next cubicle or on the other side of the world: You can write your module. This is actually what I would say if I would have to answer the original question in one sentence: Interface Design/Specification.<br><br>The above applies to small as well as large projects. My team only consists of 4-5 people, but we greatly benefit from applying appropriate amounts of process and formalism. The key word here is "appropriate". A one-man, 5000 lines-of-code project doesn't benefit from a complete Development Lifecycle. But setting firm requirements up front and spending at least some time on proper design (And documentation) would still be useful.<br><br>By the way, I have yet to see (or hear of) a tool and/or project where merging of code-changes/additions was done successfully and on a routine basis. I am not a fan of true parallel development (Where multiple people work on the same file).<br><br>Anyway, this was just a little stream-of-thought triggered by your question and the answers to it. Hope it's useful.<br><br>Jeroen

    I'll add my two cents to the thread.  I'm a game programmer and have worked on several 'typical' game projects.  Commercial game projects generally employ between 2 and 10 full-time programmers, and include as many artists and generally a manager or producer or two.  Some studios go a bit nuts and employ a lot more than that (Blizzard) but I'm not convinced they're doing the right thing.<br><br>Regarding the programming, I can't imagine doing a commercial project solo.  There are far too many details for one person too handle.  You may think you could handle the programming, but in commercial projects there is far far more than just programming.  There are installers to be made, builds processing to be managed, QA teams to be coordinated, compatibility testing and thousands of bugs to be worked through.  You NEED multiple programmers... one programmer could easily spend all his time doing all of these side tasks related to commercial development.<br><br>The teams I've worked on include one lead programmer; usually the strongest programmer on the team.  I have to disagree with Paul's suggestion that the lead is not necessarily the strongest.  Its not that the lead necessarily does most of the programming, quite the opposite actually (the lead typically stays busy with management of the projects and related tasks).  However, the ultimate responsibility for the code lies with the lead.  This means the underlying architecture should be designed by the lead, and the programming tasks should be passed out by the lead.  On every project I've been lead on, the end of the project relies very heavily on the lead's programming abilities.  The most difficult bugs and the most critical features that are falling behind schedule become the responsibility of the lead simply because no one else on the team can handle them or no one else has time to deal with them.  The lead must be able to act as a catch-all programmer because, as I said, the code is ultimately his responsibility.<br><br>I think the most important aspect of a multiple programmer project is a well defined product.  Some of the previous comments have mentioned this, but I'd like to add a few tidbits.  Solo projects are typically experimental and their features and design change rapidly.  A project like this (R&D or prototyping in commercial studios) really cannot easily implemented with multiple programmers.  A project suitable for multiple programmers should ALWAYS start with a full design.  The design is commonly accompanied with a loose prototype that has been developed by a single programmer while the game was beign designed.  Given a complete documented design and feature list, a project can easily be separated into distinct components and divvied out to each programmer.  One of the duties of the lead is to recognize division points and manage the integration of the various programmers.<br><br>For instance, on a space combat simulator game I worked on, there were three programmers.  We split the code duties into (I'm approximating here, it wasn't quite this simple) 3d rendering and game play, AI and interfaces, and "everything else" (installers, compatibility, etc).  This was a fairly easy division since none of the tasks relied too heavily on anyone elses tasks, when properly ordered.  Management of the portions that overlapped was handled by the lead by micromanaging the individual overlapping features.<br><br>As for the fear of one programmer taking over leaving the others idle -- this is a very real risk.  I call it a risk, because it is very detrimental to the project.  That one programmer typically thinks he can handle it all himself and takes 'ownership' of basically all major portions of the code.  This is very bad programming.  He may knows every nook and cranny of C++, but being a syntax guru does not come close to making you a good programmer.  The biggest part of being a good programmer is getting the project done, this means (for commercial projects) you MUST work well with others.  If I was managing a team of programmers where one became that dominant, I would consider rebuilding the team... find a better balance for the team and consider moving the dominant programmer to some other task more suited for a solo coder.  (Tools, prototyping, etc)<br><br>Ok, all done... I think that was more than my two cents though.

    Just some quick comments:<br><br>A good thing to have in mind is: <br>"All the time you spend before/beside <br>implementing does not cost you time, <br>but will actually save time"<br>Especially if you are hobby programmer or fresh from school, it <br>takes some time to really believe this sentence.<br>But after missing some deadlines because of the last 10% of the<br>project that actually took 90% of the time, you will believe it.<br><br>A book I like is "Debugging the development process":<br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1556156502/qid=990186896/sr=1-8/ref=sc_b_8/104-1169842-2721557">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1556156502/qid=990186896/sr=1-8/ref=sc_b_8/104-1169842-2721557</a><br>I think there was chapter called "Why its good to kick your starprogrammer out of the team" :-)<br><br>An interesting concept is "Extreme Programming", do a search on google and you will find plenty of information about it. The basic concept is: Take everything that is good for a project, and turn it into its extreme. Really interesting.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
