Do simulation-type games such as flight simulators/pod racers etc work just like
industrial simulations?  That is, do these games have differential equations that
need to be integrated through time?

As for pod racing games, I can't say. If I had to guess based on common
sense, I would say "probably not rigorously simulated." There is no
real-world "pod" to simulate, so where is the basis for simulation? Also,
a full blown simulation would not be necessary. They could accomplish
their goal (make a fun game) without the simulation. If it were me, I
would write some simple simulation code that avoids all the hard work that
accomplishes the goal and gives the right feel.<br><br>A flight-simulation, however is a completely different story. Having been
involved in Fly! for the past 11 months has taught me quite a lot. First,
the target market (the 'sim-heads') are fanatical about precision. We've
learned that you simply cannot please them all.  As a matter of fact,
you'll be lucky to please a small fraction of them, so the simulation is
quite necessary. If you are (or anybody else is) targetting an audience of
this nature, I have a story for you before you make any decisions...<br><br>Fly! has five aircraft, starting with our simplest is the Cessna 172R
Skyhawk (80% of all pilots learn to fly in one of these.) It's a small
single-prop plane that seats only four. We've taken on the job of
actuating every single switch, knob, dial and gauge in the cockpit. And
this is just the cockpit detail. The flight dymanics and subsystems
simulation is just as full-featured. For example, if you roll this
aircraft onto its back and try to climb, you'll find that the engine cuts
out at a certain angle.  This happens because the fuel tanks are gravity
fed and at a certain angle the fuel is no longer feeding the engines. The
guys on the Fly! team actually simulated this, and this is just one tiny
example...<br><br>As a comparison, the top selling flight simulator of all time (Microsoft
Flight Simulator) has a 747, one of the largest commercial airliners ever
made, seats hundreds. Our Cessna has more working doo-dads in the cockpit
than their 747 does. But are our beta-testers happy? Yes and no. They're
happy to see the detail we've put into our aircraft, and they're
relatively pleased with the flight model (yes, we do actually integrate
through those heavy equations) and they're happy to see that we've gone
through the trouble of actually re-creating a fully working GPS
navigational system. But are they truely happy? No. They've still got more
suggestions on top of suggestions on top of suggestions.  This is great,
since we'll always have lots of great ideas for things to add, but they
want stuff like a fully simulated weather system with real-time updates
from online METAR weather sites (the US government doesn't have this kind
of computing power.)<br><br>"Fine," we think.. just wait until they see our most sophisticated
aircraft, the Raytheon Hawker 800 XP. This is a business jet that seats
eleven (including pilot and co-pilot.)  This particular jet makes the
Cessna look like a toy (both, in our sim and in real life.) Following the
same path we took on the Cessna, you can't imagine the amount of detail we
put into this jet. Of course, when the sim-heads started playing with the
Hawker, they had more suggestions than they had with the Cessna!<br><br>Don't get me wrong, the simulation community is a very tight community and
full of some great people. I'm not just saying this to cover my butt in
case I offended anybody, they really are a great group of friendly people.
Just remember that they're as fickle as they are friendly. So use their
knowledge and their willingness to help and LISTEN to their suggestions.
They know what they want more than you do. But also remember that their
expectations are FAR beyond the means of today's technology. If you try to
please them all, you WILL go insane.<br><br>And remember this too: <b>the best goal is a goal that cannot possibly be
achieved.</b>
