This is a little off-topic, but as a shareware author, I happen to have an
interest in protection against piracy & cracking (i.e. 'reversing').<br><br>Let me start off by saying that I don't know anything about the cost or
overhead involved in burning a unique serial number onto each CD. I can say,
however, that this will do you very little (if any) good at all. Crackers
have some very sophisticated tools (SoftIce is the favorite) and they are
more on top of this stuff than you or I. I guarantee you that they are also
more on top of it than those companies you can purchase your protection from
(i.e. hardware dongles or software-based encryption/protection schemes.)<br><br>So, let's talk about protection... This is based on stuff I figured out on
my own, and while talking to people on efnet's #cracking4newbies IRC
channel. If you go there, they'll help you by giving you information on how
to best protect your program (they're actually a very friendly group of
people.) They'll also crack your program and distribute it. So use caution
if you don't want this to happen. That is, after all, what they do.<br><br>When a cracker gets his hands on a program with a key, he has two options.
(1) He can crack the program so that it no longer requires a key, or (2) he
can reverse-engineer the code to figure out how the key works and use that
information to create a 'keygen'.<br><br>There is a third option called <I>carding</I>. Carding is using a stolen
(real) credit card to buy a key and then distributing that key publicly. I
don't condone the act of cracking, but I can at least appreciate the talent
that is required by cracking some of the more difficult programs out there.
However, I find carding rather distasteful in every respect (and, as I
understand it, the cracking scene agrees with me on this.) It's also credit
card fraud, and a federal offense. Reversing, however, is not necessarily
illegal (at least, not until you distribute the crack.) You can help prevent
carding (or at least, slow it down) by having a server-side serial number
(key) check. If you find any carded keys being publicly distributed, simply
shut them off on the server. This could open up two other cans of worms...
this might make your server prone to hackers (to get keygen information) or
you might find that each time you shut down a key on the server, they card a
new key.<br><br>Can a program be made to be completely impossible to crack? No, not if you
consider what a cracker is willing to do (even hacking into server for
server-checks.) Even though I've been told (by crackers) that a program can
be made uncrackable, I personally don't think so. Instead, my goal has
always been to make the protection more effort to crack than a cracker is
willing to expend. And they're willing to expend a lot of energy for a $5
program. It has nothing to do with money; it is all about the challenge.
It's important that you understand that when you protect your program, you
are challenging a cracker to crack it.<br><br>In order to protect your program (and you will need to do this, because the
toughest key is useless if the program itself is easy to crack), you'll need
to have a small idea of how a program is cracked, and what tools they have
at their disposal.<br><br>There are some extremely sophisticated disassembles on the market. These
tools are often used by driver developers and even by large companies. For
example, IDA (Interactive DisAssembler) is one of the better tools. They
boast that it's used by government agencies to validate commercial software,
by open-source activists to support undocumented architectures, by car
tuners to make modified chips for cars, etc. I downloaded the demo of this,
and was amazed at what it did with my program. To the trained eye, this is
almost as good as having the source code.<br><br>So, how do you protect yourself against a cracker, when they've got the
source to your program? I don't know. I don't think you can. But I think you
can make it more effort than it's worth. At least, that's what I'm hoping
for from my protection.<br><br>When a cracker wants to crack a program they know that more often than not,
the protection will simply result in a conditional jump or two. You might
have an RSA encrypted key, but if your result is to simply check to see if
that key is valid, you're going to end up in a conditional jump someplace
after all the decryption code has run. If they comment out that jump
instruction, or switch the condition, then your protection has been foiled.<br><br>My approach was a bit different. My approach was to create a key that is
required for the program to run. Not logically, with conditions, but by
actually using the key in the code itself. For example, there might be a
math formula stored in the key. All keys have different values, but after
the formula is run, the result is always the same across all keys (i.e.
10-1=9 and 7+2=9). I might use this value as a stepping value through a
loop. If I packed my key with a lot of formulas, and used them in various
places in the code, then the key is an integral part of the program. But
will that stop a cracker? Nope. They just find all the places where I use
the key, and crack them individually. This time they're not swapping out
conditional jumps they're replacing the key calculation code with a few
instructions that simply place the result from a formula into a register.
And they can easily find all the places where I use the key, by using the
disassembling tools and searching the ASM source.<br><br>But I think this is a good start, so I decided to enhance it a little. My
goal was to place so many key checks in my program that they couldn't
possibly crack them all. At the same time, I didn't want to pollute my
program's source with thousands of key checks. As a solution, I decided to
use a few simple #defines.<br><br>After a few well designed #define statements (so I was sure everything was
inlined) I was able to proliferate my key checks so much, that my executable
grew by 300K. My key checks are 33% of my program's size. So, as an example:<br><br><center><div style="width:100%; overflow:auto; background-color:#FFFFFF; border:solid 1px #c0c0c0;"><table width="100%" bgcolor="#ffffff" cellspacing=0 cellpadding=12 border=0><tr><td width="100%" bgcolor="#ffffff"><pre><font face="Courier, Courier New" color="#000000">    <font color="#0000ff">#define</font> <font color="#0000ff">sizeof</font>(a)  (keycheck_calculation + <font color="#0000ff">sizeof</font>(a)) </font></pre></td></tr></table></div></center><br><br>If that particular key check calculation were supposed to result in zero,
the program would run fine. However, if an invalid key was used, the result
drastically affects the way the program operates, and probably makes it
crash.<br><br>There's still more work to do. You have to secure all aspects of the program
as tightly as possible, because a cracker <I>will</I> find the weakest link.
For example, my program requires a registration code to run. The trial
version of the software simply disables the save feature. If I were able to
allow people to register the trial version by simply entering a key, then
the cracker could simply crack the trial version to enable the save.<br><br>Instead I would need to have two separate versions of the program
(trial/registered.) The trial version would have the save code conditionally
compiled out, so there's nothing to crack. Or is there? Couldn't the cracker
compare the differences between the trial version and the registered version
and simply add the code to the trial version? Yes, they could. Fortunately,
with my key checks proliferated throughout my registered version so
thoroughly, finding this extra code would be a nightmare. Not impossible,
but very difficult, especially if the needed code from the registered
version was littered with key checks.<br><br>This was about as much effort as I was willing to put into it (at this
point, it was about an evening's worth of work.) Since it was just an
evening's worth of work, if I found that my program was cracked, I would
simply change the protection in the next version. After all, I was writing a
shareware program, not a protection library.<br><br>One thing I haven't covered is the actual key generation. Ideally, you want
your keys to be non-reversible, even if the cracker has the source code to
see how they work, they don't have enough information to actually create a
valid key (much like how many popular encryption algorithms work today.) I
won't go into how mine works. Besides, I'm not an encryption expert by any
stretch of the imagination. My goal was to make it (what I thought of as)
un-reversible, and hide the rest in obscurity. :)<br><br>There are a lot of other aspects that I haven't covered (like checksums in
your program to make sure it doesn't get patched, debugger-detection, etc.)
I didn't cover them because most of them are useless. At best, they'll slow
the hacker down and waste a few minutes their time. More importantly, I
didn't cover so many aspects because I'm simply not even aware of them. I'm
not an expert. If you really want serious help on this topic, go find an
expert cracker that's willing to help you.

    I have thought about this somewhat and can't really come up with anything fool proof either.  But inserting a bunch of algorithmic code checks sounds like a great idea, but if all those checks are the same or similar, couldn't a hacker just do a search and replace for the ASM snippit throughout the exe?  If you had another program which takes your source and randomly inserts different algrothimic source (in appropriate places of course) this would fix the search and replace problem.<br><br>And I don't really even see how the #define keycheck_calculation would do any good.  Since keycheck_calculation is just a global variable, couldn't a hacker just modify the varible on startup to be the correct value, then they wouldn't even have to mess with any of the keycheck code which is throughout the code?

    There's a CD protection scheme that is pretty difficult to crack that I've used in production.  I don't remember the name of it, it's been a while, but basically the idea is that it marks a number of sectors on the CD as bad.  Well, those sectors happen to contain data.  So when you copy the CD, the burner skips over those sectors, and the copy doesn't work.  Doesn't help against someone dumping an image though.<br><br>goltrpoat

    Oh by the way, to add to what MidNight said..  let's say there's a key and a function of that key that reduces it to a certain number.  Another function of it transforms that number, if it's valid to, say, machine code for RETF.  Declare a variable right before the outcode declaration, cast the pointer to that variable to a function pointer and call it.  If the outcode is correct, the function will return, if it isn't, it, well, hopefully won't.  A few of those, nested, would be a serious nightmare to debug.<br><br>goltrpoat<br>

    As I type this, my shareware program got the 5th registration of the day. So far, for this month, that's an average of one registration every 8 hours.<br><br>I can guarantee you that this wouldn't be the case without this protection. At one point, there was a keygen available for my program that didn't work (it simply generated keys that survived the checksum test with a checksum of 0.) The keygen, however, did not survive the crucible to follow. :) The software would act very flaky with an invalid key. I even got a bunch of emails from people complaining about these problems. [shrug]<br><br>The software automatically checks for updates of itself. In order to do so, it must query the server for a text file. When you send a query to a web server, you include the browser information. In my case, the browser was shown as "3D Mail Effects Version Checker (S)" or "3D Mail Effects Version Checker (R)" -- The S and R mean 'shareware' or 'registered'.<br><br>Well, once that keygen was released, I noticed a LOT of people running the registered version. I knew about the keygen, and I knew that it wasn't working, because I could watch my HTML logs, see somebody appear running the shareware version, then the registered version, then try a bunch of times with the registered version, and finally, they would be running the shareware version again. This was a very common occurance. Over 80% of my logs were full of this kind of activity.<br><br>I also watched my sales drop. When I put out the next revision to the software, it no longer allowed keys with checksums of 0, even if the checksum was correct. This defeated that particular keygen. From that point on, the suspicious activity went away and my sales picked back up.<br><br>I almost felt like Frankenstein held up in a castle with the torch-bearing city dwellers outside just waiting for the door to open so they could flood in. Obviously, I did the prudent thing and tightened the locks. :)<br><br><b><i>- MidNight</i></b>

    Long time ago under DOS - there was kind of WEIRD copy protection - but it was not used for final products - but internally - to protect copying programs amongst people in network - blahaa blaa<br><br>So the idea was that SECTOR SIZE was like 512 bytes or 1024 bytes (can't remmember - also probably not sector but cluster).<br><br>So if you have file with size 500 bytes (which still is 512 bytes as sector). Then if you seek at 511 byte (after the end of file) and write something - some information - key or whatever. And then seek back to 500 and CUT the file (in TurboPascal the function was Trunc(f) - hehe - old-old-times). So if one copies this file it will copy without this info. if you move the file - everything will be fine - cause Move only change directory information. And then how this can be used - I wrote years ago with a friend of mine a simple copy protection scheme for .EXE files which wanted password before the EXE file starts. Actually password never failed - if the password was invalid then file wile be decoded wrong - and will hang eventually. But then we needed instead of typing everytime this password to keep it somewhere - and here you are!<br><br>This was still working on Win95 (not sure for Win98) - but on NTFS especially with compressed files - this does not work.... Anyway - this can find still somewhere some usage.<br><br>Of course, if "Mr.Hacker" is aware of that fact - he can make a CopyFile routine which reads and that "hidden" portion.<br><br>Get MS-DOS 5.00, TurboPascal 6.00 and have fun (oh..oh.. i still have TurboPascal 3.00 in my utility directory)...

    Zen,<br><br>I was about to ask the same question (:<br><br>Anyway, I realized middle of the typing that it's not completely protected way. You can always make full copy of the CD and spread valid key with that, but in warez scene, there is always ripped (music / speech / anims ripped out) versions of the software for sake of faster transfer. Not everyone have the joy of using 10MBit/s connection to download full CD images.<br><br>So, you could spread vital information around the CD (for instance at specific track locations), and check that info when your program starts, which would force having full copy of the CD or cracking the protection.<br><br>I don't know any percentage figures about how much warez is spreaded as full CD images and how much as rips, but I would guess that rips are vast majority there. My pessimistic guess is that it's 95% of rips, 5% of full images (assuming only warezing in the net, not criminal leagues who actually press CD's), so if you would be able to cut out that 95%, that would be really good already. But to cut out that 95%, you would need to make cracking of the protection veeeeery hard.<br><br>Unfortunately you can't rely, that client who bought your application got network connection (except if it's network only app), what for you can't rely on on-line registration, which would collect some info of your machine and send it to the server which would generate personal key for you thus making it work only on your machine. This would provide 100% protection of your software (in theory), if you could make the application crack protection fully protected.<br><br>Of course you could like force client, who doesn't have network connection, to run some software, which he/she would get from reseller of your software, provide information collected by that software to the reseller who would generate the key for him/her, but I bet no client likes dancing like that between home & store (: Though, this kind of feature could be integrated to OS, so forgetting to take that 'digital signature' with you, is like forgetting your wallet at home.<br><br>Naturally this kind of hardware configuration specific key would have pitfall in system upgrading. Also crackers would probably build some software, which would hook API's used to collect that system specific information, particularly if the digital signature construction is OS feature.<br><br>Well, these are just my thoughts without any practical experience on the subject (:<br><br>Cheers, Altair<br>

    There is a saying, which I think is apt: "Locks only keep honest people out".  I think software protection is a similar thing.  We (the honest users) go through the trials and tribulations of locking and unlocking the door (games with CD checks), whereas the pirates climb through the windows.  The CD keys are good, but they don't work in all situations (take Pauls for example).

    Almost whatever you do, it will be broken. Just look at safedisc CD<br>protection - they went to great lengths to make it uncopyable. As far<br>as I remember, they even claimed that it is uncopyable. It took some<br>time, but generic unwrapping tools are available for safedisc now.<br>And before that, manual dumping&restoring was being done large-scale.<br><br>As for CD-images versus rips, it all comes down to what linespeed you<br>have and what people you know; funny enough, those two seem to be<br>very tighly connected. I have a little warezpuppy friend with a 512kbit<br>line, and he has a decent amount of "friends" by now. The faster the<br>linespeed, the more people you get to know. Traders, sigh.<br><br>Requiring on-line registration, or other mean stuff (like the rumored<br>protection in whistler) will only make people angry, and will be to<br>no avail - if it runs at all, it will be made into running allways :).<br>Patches are, as far as I know, already available for black&white to<br>get rid of the spyware.<br><br>I'm in no way a "1337 h4xx0r", nor a master cracker. I don't have any<br>illusions with regards to my "skillz". But skilled people do exist.<br>As has been mentioned earlier, they will go to great lengths, even for<br>a $5 shareware app that they don't have a use for. Imagine the dedication<br>when they get their hands on dongle-protected software, or other very<br>intriguing schemes.<br><br>Conclusion? Stop pissing us off with protection schemes that only makes<br>life harder for the legitimate customers. I must admit that I am using<br>warez to some degree - otherwise I would be a hypocrite. But unless the<br>little leeching kiddos, I go out and buy software every once in a while,<br>if I really like it. I had the quake leeched beta, the warez full version,<br>and yet I still went out and bought the game. I have black&white ISO,<br>but still I'm going to buy the game as soon as it hits the shops.<br>And even though I buy the games, *I STILL APPLY CRACKS*. I hate having<br>to put the CD in my drive to run the games - bringing your original<br>CDs to (large) lan parties is not fun. And look at safedisc...with<br>my CD drive (and a couple of my friends' drives), between thirty secs<br>and a minute is spent just on verifying the CD. 30-60 seconds might not<br>sound like a lot, but as an exercise, try staring at a little splash<br>screen for 60 seconds (time it). Not very fun, is it? After unsafedisc<br>(and sometimes a little manual reversing, as some software authors<br>don't think safedisc is enough :-), the games start almost instantaneously.<br>

    Oh, I forgot a "little" thing. I believe (server-side checked) CD<br>keys are good, as long as they're only validated when you're playing<br>on the large online servers - NOT when you're playing on a LAN, or<br>over the internet with your own server. One thing is warezing the game<br>(which is a bad thing, even if I do it myself). Another thing is abusing<br>the bandwith of online servers, and making legitimate owners unable<br>to play. I like the way halflife handles this.<br>

    I didn't mean that there would be some specific key on the CD. I mean that there would be content on the CD (same for all CD's), which would be checked at fixed locations (at specific tracks) hence making full CD image (or cracking) compulsory. If you would just copy CD content, some of that check data isn't there and your program wouldn't start. For instance the empty space on the CD (not in TOC) could be filled with random data and when application starts, every 100th track would be checked that it contains correct data.<br><br>Naturally that should be made far more complicated than that to make crackers nuts, but that's the basic idea. But as I said, you could still just make full copy of the CD, but it's the minority who does this. Still, I would go for some HW signature thing, so that the size of the media wouldn't be the limiting factor for copying.<br><br>Cheers, Altair<br>

    <b>AFAIK</b> most cracking groups won't release a patch for program unless it is <b>impossible</b> to code a keygen for it. (Impossible = no one in the group can do it).<br><br>I thought of a couple of ways to make things "impossible" -<br>1) Using weird math functions that has no real meaning (or even ones like counting how many times a digit is found in a number). "WhatIs" style of function should really help.<br>2) Use inline functions for everything evolved in the registration code. Whatever you do, avoid functions like:<br><pre>BOOL IsRegistered();</pre>Patching such function so it will always return true, won't take more than 10 seconds.<br>

    Software protection is very difficult to get right and depends largely on who will use your program. It sounds like Midnight's program has very wide appeal but not use by companies...<br><br>I small company I worked for used quite a basic check for registration but was tied to the machine. This was okay for us but meant that users had to ask us for a new key if they changed their machine. This was required to ensure that one copy was not simply installed on a whole department full of machines... (quite a possiblility in this case). <br><br>There is an alternative to protection and that is to try a different business model (so that protection is not required). The sucess of this approach usually depends on the type of software though.... The extreme example of a different model is Open Source. Essentially, your program is free but users pay for added value. I have had people talk at me about this several times and I am not convinced. It might work for large programs but $5 utilities rarely enter into it. One related option is to get a company / user who wants a new feature to pay for it, on the condition that the final product is released to all. I have heard that several people have done okay on this.<br><br>The one I most like though relies on honesty and the product having company appeal- the 'free for personal use' licence. Companies are more likely to buy legal software and are more likely to be able to have bigger funds (eg: they *wanted* to pay 4000 for software which we thought worth no more than 500). <br><br>If you are writing software with a view to making money then pick your product carefully. I personally think that writing the software because you wanted to and then trying to make money from it is nigh on impossible - my stuff is freeware....<br><br>Just my 2p worth.<br><br>Steve.

    Don't bother :]. Even if you DO manage to get an unreversible (ie,<br>no keygenning possible) algorithm going, and if you manage to spread<br>the checks all over (and not making them "cmp eax, 1" type checks)...<br>as soon as a cracking group gets hold of a leaked serial/key, you can<br>be sure they'll work something out.<br><br>RSA will be factored if it's small enough ("small" being a number that<br>constantly increases, due to faster CPUs, and soon probably also distributed<br>methods).<br><br>IDA might be one of the only applications I've seen that has a very<br>good scheme. Watermarks all over, so you can be pretty sure that a<br>person who bought it will NOT be leaking it. But 4.04 got to the<br>cracking scene after all, the "gary colton" carded release.<br><br>>"Using weird math functions that has no real meaning".<br>Why, if they have no meaning? Sure, they will work as obfuscation,<br>making it a bit harder to find the spot where you need to apply the<br>sting (which is what cracking is all about 90% of the time, finding<br>"that magic location"). But these days, it will take a LOT to fool<br>the crackers you are up against. There are *very* sophisticated tools<br>out there for crackers, by crackers.<br><br>The icedump for softice project deserves a look - it's amazing.<br><a target="_blank" href="http://icedump.tsx.org">http://icedump.tsx.org</a><br><br>If you really intend on protecting your software, I suggest you read<br>up a lot before thinking up a method. Fravia's not-frozen mirror at<br><a target="_blank" href="http://tsehp.cjb.net">http://tsehp.cjb.net</a> shows how many crackers think, and is an invaluable<br>resource, for crackers as well as protectionists. Be sure to read<br>some of the older stuff as well.<br><br>If you want to keep crackers away, you have to learn to think as a<br>cracker. It's not enough to have something that looks neat in visual<br>studio - you have to get down to the nitty-gritty asm stuff - have<br>a look at your code in a dissasembler and a asm-level debugger.<br><br>The most important thing? NEVER, *EVER* buy ready-made protection.<br>Some of it might be tough, and last for a while. But there will almost<br>always be a generic unpacker around. The harder the challenge the more<br>skilled crackers (who deserver to be called reversers) will join the fray.<br>

    Paul,<br><br>Thanks for responding to my question and for all the good info - however it missed my point.  I am not trying to "crack-proof" a program, I just want some general guidance on how to generate good unique CD keys.  <br><br>Let's stick to a specific situation:  <br><br>The keys would be generated by a program that is not available to the crackers and checked by a program running on a registration server.  So, barring crackers hacking into the server or my development box, there will be no disassembly of either the key-generation or key-checking code.<br><br>But the crackers will have the key itself.  Probably multiple keys if a group collects them through means legal or nefarious.<br><br>What I am looking for are solid ideas about how to generate keys in such a way that if a group manages to get say 100 or even 1000 keys to study - and even if they figure out 99% of the key generation method - it would still be statistically daunting for them to generate new valid keys.<br><br>I realize that this doesn't provide much protection of the software, but it should provide some validation to its registration - that being the real goal in this case.<br><br>Warv

    Face it, if a program requires a static key, that's it. Anyone can pirate it. Just down a program and the related key.<br><br>The only "uncrackable" software is software that connects to an uncrackable source (e.g. server on the internet) for vital info every time, or once every day, or something. If you're making a multiplayer game, that's the way to go. Then only registered users can log in. Quake 3 has practically no single-player protection (AFAIK) and there's really no need for it -- someone would crack it right away, and this way it's more friendly.<br><br>So forget about crack protection, is my advice. If your program will become popular, someone could just visit #serialz and someone will have a serial for your program, whatever it is. There will probably be someone who registered your program and just gave out the serial to it. Or keygenned it.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Greg

    a guid is a 128 bit random number statistically guaranteed to be unique.  i've heard there are more guids than stars in the universe.  anyways, a guid is generated using your network NIC number and some other OS and hardware info.  since there is a central authority issuing NIC numbers to network card manufacturers, this number is absolutely guaranteed to be unique, so part of a guid is unique.  the reason the whole thing isn't unique is because what if you don't have a network card, then it just uses some pseudo random number stuff to fill in the gaps.  as with any random number generator, if you know the seed value and random number gen algorithm, they are absolutely predictible, but this would imply that your GUID renderer, lol, security would be compromised (ie they have broken into your server)<br><br>also, i don't know if this is true, but i've heard that from any guid, you can reverse extrapolate the NIC it was issued from, that would be interesting...<br><br><b><u>ZEN</u></b>

    This is totally off topic, but I'm going to post this here anyway.<br><br>I'm one of those people that feels that mankind, for the most part, means well. That you won't get stabbed in the back by every other person you meet. I also feel that when good things happen, they should be reported along with the bad. So here's something that just happened to me...<br><br>I decided to stop off at the local Taco Bell on the way back from Best Buy (typical day in the life of a programmer, eh? :) After ordering, I pulled up to the drive-in window and the guy in the window asked if I wanted anything to drink. I hadn't ordered anything because I expected to drink what I had at home. He then asked if I was sure I didn't want anything, because it would be "on the house." So I went ahead and ordered a drink. When he returned with the free drink, he had told me that my drink was free because I was so polite when I placed my order.<br><br>I guess people tend to forget to say "thank you" when talking into a speaker.<br><br>Anyway, this public forum is as good as any, so I figured I'd spread some cheer.<br><br>As you were. :)<br><br><b><i>- MidNight</i></b>

    After reading all the great comments and thinking about this issue some more, it seems to me that the main problem is that people don't look at software as property.  Many MANY people who'd never steal a physical possession or even shoplift some candy will steal software in abundance with out a concideration.  Doesn't make them bad, but it does mean we can't be naive and not protect our software.<br><br>With that in mind, taking comments from everyone here and some ideas by Microsoft, I thought I'd propose a solution (Not bullet proof, but very limiting) that might work and see what people think.<br><br>Essentially the idea lies in generating the keys based on some basic system info, proc speed/brand, mother-board info, ram info (speed, size), OS serial number (questionable), and Serial number for the program.  All of this would generate the number and then the user would either call or go online and register this number with the company.  The company could then decode this and fill in the information in their database (Nothing would be collected that would conflict with privacy issues).  The server would then generate a confirmation number which would be sent back to the user via the web or phone.<br><br>This number would be valid as long as certain pieces of hardware wasn't changed.  As soon as that happened then the number would be voided and the program would attempt to autogenerate/verify another number with the company server through the web and provide the user a number to call if that doesn't work.  They'd check that number, decode the product serial number, compare that to a database of sold product serial numbers, and void the old number.<br><br>The verification code in the program would be implemented as Midnight suggested, obfustication being the goal, not total prevention, so that by the time a crack came out your product would hopefully go through one sales-cycle uncorrupted.  Then a new version or patch could be released to make them go through it all over again.<br><br>Some issues would be if someone steals a valid key, how would you prevent them from replacing a valid users?  This would be done by requiring the user to create a user name and password when first installing the program, which would be how the company would verify your legitimacy to that serial number.<br><br>Lastly, just to be a real bitch about things, the program would auto-verify it's self every time you logged onto the web.  This would be done in the background and would just be an extra measure to make it annoying to crack.<br><br>One other idea, though I don't like it, is to combine the obfustication method with actually making the program break your system if you try to run a cracked version and providing very clear forwarning.  A popular FTP client does this, but I can't recall which.  Makes it REALLY annoying to crack it.  Again, this last bit I don't really like.  The goal is just to make it so that it takes a long time to crack and therefore you get a chance to maximize sales.<br><br>Ideas?  comments?  Seem valid?  Holes?  I know it'd take a bit of work to implement, but then again, you'd be able to reuse it on all your products as well as long as you changed your obfustication.<br><br>-Hosed

    I have seen several of you talking about how the user is losing here. And I feel the same way, many of you have probably been using software that stopped working or old dos programs/games which on a newer computer claims that a debug is running os similar.<br><br>What I hate about software protection is that many methods are fragile, meaning that in the near future with a new computer or os they are going to malfunction. And another fragile method is using bad sectors or hidden sectors, there are many ways it can fail. And what is the idea about server registration and have to order a new key. Not every one has internet yet or want the trouble. In a few years when the sales are down or the company closes how will people get new keys.<br><br>And forget about protecting the cd, today some tools can emulate a cd and it's protection. Take a look at www.deamon-tools.com for instance, with this tool you can mount cd images with a perfectly emulated cd driver, theres even options for emulating several protection schemes like safedisck and securom.<br><br>And there is no suck thing as a un-crackable program! If it runs somehow then theres a way to trace the protection and break it.<br><br>If you can make protection thats almost unbreakable and make it last, so it runs forever without having to re-register, then i have no problems with it.

    I've released a couple of pretty simple shareware games, I've set the fee to $5 more as a way for me to see if someone actually plays the games rather than a way to get money. These games are tetris-style, dice, card, etc. I.e. pretty simple stuff directed towards a non-hardcore user.<br><br>The protection mechanism is a simple standard name/regcode thing, with the registration code matching the name. This usually prevents a registered user of sharing the code with others, because his/hers name is needed. The key generation algorithm is very simple and it all comes down to a conditional jump.<br><br>By checking the HTTP_REFERER environment variable in my webserver logs I easily see where people are coming from. Shortly after a new version or new release I did often see a lot of hits from crack-sites with serials, patches or keygens and could easily track down a crack and when it got released.<br><br>Just for the fun of it I thought that I should crack my own program. Reading a couple of cracking-tutorials on the web I used WDASM (spelling? a disassembler anyway, this was a couple of years ago), a hexeditor and SoftIce. I don't consider myself as someone knowing assembler, but I do have some small distant memories since my Amiga (68000) days quite some years ago so it's not entirely unknown.<br><br>I fired up SoftIce in the background, I set a breakpoint when reading the editbox (GetWindowTextA) when the user clicked OK in the registration window. From that point I traced my way through until I found the conditional jump, checked the offset and then simply replaced that single JNE with a JMP in the file with the hexeditor and saved all back.<br><br>That was it. No matter what registration code it does work. IMHO, very, very easy... even easy for someone who've never done any real cracking before.<br><br>Doing some more research it turned out to be that about 90% of the so called crackers are just people who frankly don't know more than this (i.e. replacing a jne with a jmp). So by doing your protection just slightly more advanced than this you may get rid of a large potion of the "newbie" crackers. However, it will still be cracked by some more experienced cracker, but at least your software doesn't turn up on every single crackpage because everyone managed to crack it.<br><br>I know that no matter what I do it'll get cracked by someone just days after it's released, so I don't really put that much effort in making a better protection. I also believe it's a matter of what kind of software you're doing, in my case it was a very simple dice-game. Most of my paying users hardly know how to unzip an archive, and probably haven't even heard about the term "crack" and certainly not how to find it. I still got, what I consider, pretty ok sales since releasing the first version in 1997 without any major updates. On the other hand... if no crack was available, I don't know if my sales would look different.<br><br>Quite some shareware authors I've talked to have recommended ASProtect, a tool for protecting software. The authors seems very skilled and when searching around crackpages on the net it actually seems he's keeping on step ahead of the crackers. Consider checking it out at:<br> <br> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aspack.com/asprotect.htm">http://www.aspack.com/asprotect.htm</a><br><br>It's also interesting to see the different techniques used for protection (compression, encryption, counteractions against debuggers/disassemblers, etc).<br><br>That's my 2 cents... hope I shared something useful/interesting.<br><br>

    Thanks stefpet for the link.<br><br>This article spiked a real interest in me and I've been pursuing this topic further ever sense.  As everyone pretty much agrees, a uncrackable program is impossible.  It has to be loaded into memory some way and once it's there it's free for prying eyes.<br><br>I think Midnight had the right idea, embedding weird calculations and behavior based on the checks, but I like the idea that Insomniac (I think) used for Spyro.  The goal wasn't to prevent cracking, just to slow it down by a couple of months.  They actually made the game unbeatable unless it was fully cracked.  Doing weird things like making your jump just slightly shorter so you couldn't make a critical jump (Bad game design, but I'll leave that to another discussion), having switches and various other game states behave differently, etc, proved to make it a real bitch to crack.  Apparently they did it all with check-sums, but I hear there are programs that'll auto remove check sums so who knows.  It staled cracks by 3 months though.  They even had a group release a cracked version that they thought worked, but then 1000s of people got pissed off about the game not being beatable because the crackers didn't bother to actually play the game to see if it worked.  It's like hack prevention.  The best protection is misinformation.<br><br>Me, I'm going to aim at a more general "dumber" audience.  If crackers/hackers/warezers want to punish themselves by preventing companies from releasing quality titles, so be it.  Ultimately that's what's happening after all.<br><br>-Hosed

    I took a good look at ASProtect.  This is a really cool product.  It's an actual SDK solution and not some stupid encoder or other less effective solution.  I'm sold on it.  The last version took 3 months to crack and was only cracked via a keygen and that hole has been totally blocked in the newest version.<br><br>Thanks again stefpet.  This was exactly what I've been looking for and will save me countless hours of work to try and achieve the same effect.<br><br>-Hosed

    Okay, let's see.<br><br>How many copies has Serious Sam sold?<br><br>I bring up SS because there is no copy protection on it, and the game is priced reasonably while also being a fun game.  I rarely buy PC games (especially not Windows-only ones), but those two factors together made buying SS a no-brainer for me.<br><br>Does Quake 3 <em>really</em> need to be $50?  I mean, I once read that due to id's low operating overhead (since they're such a small outfit), they only need to sell 100,000 copies of a game to make a tidy profit.  Imagine how many people would buy it if it were priced only at $20-$25, and didn't have any key protection!  Myself, I can't stand the thought of having Q3 in any way due to its (IMO asinine) copyright protection scheme.  I know I'm not the only one, either.<br><br>I know this sounds naive, but wouldn't it make more sense to make people want to buy a game rather than wanting to pirate it?

    My friend and I were actually discussing this on our way from school and we thought of a few novel ideas, the most promising of was to hinder the game like someone above mentioned.  A good one we thought of was to slow a game down (i.e. fps).  At certain intervals, if the game isn't cracked properly the game starts chugging.  When you see your framerate drop to oh 10fps what's your first thought?  "Damn video card!  I need a better processor"  Time this with say gun fire or explosions and most people won't realize what is happening.  As time goes on make it worse and worse, destabilize the program even more.  The last part is because some people actually pirate games for "trial" then go out and buy it.  Give them a week to "try" it then hit'em hard.

    The question of software piracy boils down to the question of crytography. <br><br>Unfortunately, the fact is that for Internet-less games, the computer is a closed system with no trusted source and, therefor, will be cracked.  Whether it's "faking" a CD-ROM drive, or cracking the code itself, or discovering the private key built in to the software, whatever scheme you come up with will be reversed.  And fast.<br><br>With the Internet at our disposal, it's much easier: you can use public key cryptography to force the user to connect to the correct server, and thus you have a trusted source that can generate some kind of valid start sequence/packet.  If you're really paranoid, use an encrypted connection to hide the authentication sequence (and thus will be harder to spoof at the TCP/IP level).  Then your server can do things like<br><br>(a) Look at the private key of the game, generated at install time (or maybe the user's credit card number?  Or username/password?)<br><br>(b) Study statistics of usage information, i.e., why is user 123 logged on 75 times from all over the globe?<br><br>(c) Get demographics; how long do people play in one sitting?  How far do they get?  Did anybody discover the secret treasure room?  You may have ethical issues to consider... :)<br><br>(d) Query the user's setup (what is the checksum of the binary they are currently using?)  Again, ethics here...<br><br>Some closing notes: <br><br>About 50% of sales occur in the first 2 months.  Delay crackers for that long, and you can count yourself lucky.<br><br>I'm a Linux/Open Source nut, but believe in commercial software.  If you use public key crypto to prevent piracy, ship the source code of your game engine along with the (copyrighted, protected) game data.  Then maybe some kid will learn from it and build me a holosuite 20 years from now.<br><br><br>--Derek Simkowiak<br>

    Hey guys,<br><br>I just briefly scanned through this page so this issue may have allready beed discussed and I missed it,<br>but anyway, here`s what I`d do (I don`t know if it would be any good):<br><br>In your program you have one or more vital procedures, like main loop etc...<br>Solution is you encrypt the code of these procedures with some strong symmetric process (you can make your own).<br><br>Let`s imagine your normally compiled and linked program.<br>=====<br>When you write and link the program all the code is converted into numbers and packed into code area. After this block constants come and then static variables` block. And this is EXE file (plus the header).<br>After you run the program, EXE is just read into memory as a block of numbers at offset 400000h. Memory pages that hold code are marked as read-only and you cannot write into them not causein a page fault. Same is with constants. On the other hand static variables block is marked as read-write and you can write into it whenever you want.<br><br>At this point your vital functions exist unencrypted at some specific offsets in the memory. When they are called, they are executed.<br><br>The idea is to take the hex numbers of those valuable functions (areas of code) and encrypt them hard. If they are encrypted, CPU understands those numbers as totally different commands as they originally are. When user starts the program, he needs to enter the password (or something like that), then the password may be converted into a hash and with this hash you then operate on the encrypted blocks of code. If the hash was correct, you`ll come up with the original code. If it wasn`t correct, you`ll get just rubbish bytes. When CPU then tries to execute those bytes, if they`ve been unencrypted correctly, everything is OK, if not, program will crash to desktop.<br><br><br>How to do it?<br>=====<br>Under DOS you could do this:<br>Compile the program into exe. Find the offsets of your procedures and encrypt those areas of exe file. Then when file is executed, it itself tries to decrypt those areas.<br><br>Under Windows, code area is read only and the upper process would cause a page fault.<br>So, to mangle with the code areas, you need to take them out.<br><br>I`d do this:<br>Delete all your valuable functions out of the source code.<br>Write a program that will dynamically allocate blocks of memory for your procedures, and at places where you need to call these procedures, call these allocated blocks instead.<br>If these procedures need any external references (global variables or other functions from allover the program), pass those offsets on stack.<br>Compile and link.<br><br>Take the source code of your vital functions and assemble it manually.<br>If you need any of the global variables or other functions, you cannot address them directly since the offsets change at every link time (if you changed the code). Instead, program will pass these offsets on stack so expect them there.<br>You must make all calls non-relative (absolute, so the are not offset dependent).<br><br>Now, compile this offset-independent code. You get a bunch of hex codes.<br>Write them down into a small file and encrypt it.<br><br>When main program executes, it reads this small file with encrypted code, tries to decrypt it and executes it.<br><br><br>What are cracker`s options?<br>=====<br>He can extract the decryption procedure from the main exe. Then:<br><br>a) Steal some valid password and corresponding encrypted code files (you cannot fight against this)<br>b) Run a brute force attack on encrypted code files<br><br><br>

    hi there,<br><br>i just got a nice idea about things like a <br>bool TestSerialNumber(sn Serial)<br>function. If a cracker comes, his first intent is (or at least i think it is) to change the function, so that it always returns true, no matter which serial was entered. However, the happy cracker thinks he has done the oh so easy job and releases the crack, which works fine (for now). Actually, the idea is to run a second test on the serial check a week after the installation, but with a bad(!) serial. If the test returns true (-> cracked), the program shuts down, reporting an error to insert the cd. The crack user thinks that the burned cd does not work anymore and perhaps chooses to buy it. <br><br>Additionally, the program leaves a mark on the computer (don't ask me where - some people manage it to put things somewhere so that you cant find it...) which disables the reinstall (->"please insert cd") unless the installation cd is different from the first time (there must be a way to determine this).<br><br>Yes, the goal is to delay the release of the crack. I got the idea of this system just when reading your statements. Don't worry, it's just a thought (even though i like it :) and it has to be improved to be of worth. But i can imagine, all the things you've said implemented in one game... hell, that would not be easy to crack, I think.<br><br>cheers,<br><br>Johannes<br>(still learning D3D, that's it. and still 15, tho :)

    Master of Orion 1 had a nice copy-protection. A ship's image appeared, and the program requested its name, as described in the manual. This may sound simple, however cracking was difficult, since there were several locations in the code involved in the copy protection. Also, several parts of the program performed a check on the EXE. If severe changes were found, the program did not refuse to work, however sometimes unexplainable events could happen while playing, like credits disappearing, ships exploding etc. Thus, it became impossible to win, killing the fun in playing it. Because one could not immediately notice if the crack was successfull or not, it was very difficult to crack it.<br>Today one simple downloads a sheet with the images & the names, it is a nice idea, though.
