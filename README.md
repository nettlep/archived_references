## Description of contents

This is a collection of old documents I wrote, in their original form.

These are rather old, written when I was much younger.

Please be kind.

## Why preserve this?

Because history matters. This code is a snapshot of how things were done back then—and in some cases, how they’re still done today. Think of it as open source time travel.

Happy coding!
